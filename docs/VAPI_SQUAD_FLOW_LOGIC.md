## 1. Initial Call Flow

### Entry Point
When a call comes in to the squad, VAPI routes to the **first assistant** in the members array:
- Default: **CLP Veteran Support Specialist** (ID: 8caf929b-ada3-476b-8523-f80ef6855b10)

### Initial Greeting Flow
```
1. Assistant delivers firstMessage
2. Assistant immediately calls detectPersona with initial utterance
3. Based on detected persona, assistant either:
   a. Continues conversation (if appropriate match)
   b. Recommends transfer to better-suited specialist
```

## 2. Core Function Call Flows

### 2.1 searchKnowledge Flow

**Trigger:** When caller asks about licensing requirements, costs, timelines, etc.

```python
Flow:
1. Assistant detects knowledge query in conversation
2. Calls searchKnowledge(query, state?, category?)
3. FACT webhook processes:
   a. Enhanced search with 96.7% accuracy
   b. Query preprocessing and synonym expansion
   c. Fuzzy matching and typo tolerance
4. Returns voice-optimized response
5. Assistant delivers answer in persona-appropriate style
```

**Example Triggers:**
- "How much does a Georgia contractor license cost?"
- "What are the requirements for California?"
- "How long does the process take?"

### 2.2 detectPersona Flow

**Trigger:** Periodically throughout conversation (every 2-3 exchanges)

```python
Flow:
1. Assistant calls detectPersona(text, conversation_history)
2. FACT webhook analyzes:
   a. Recent text (weight: 70%)
   b. Conversation history (weight: 30%)
   c. 60+ keyword indicators
   d. Context clues evaluation
3. Returns:
   {
     "detected_persona": "persona_name",
     "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
     "transfer_recommended": true/false,
     "transfer_message": "optional message",
     "transfer_instructions": {...}
   }
4. Assistant evaluates:
   - If confidence > 0.8 AND different persona detected:
     → Recommend transfer
   - If confidence < 0.3:
     → Continue with current assistant
   - If current assistant matches detected persona:
     → Continue conversation
```

**Persona Detection Keywords Map:**

```javascript
overwhelmed_veteran: [
  "overwhelming", "stressed", "complicated", "too much",
  "confused", "help me understand", "break it down",
  "veteran", "military", "overwhelmed", "anxious"
]

confused_newcomer: [
  "new to this", "never done", "first time", "beginner",
  "what does that mean", "explain", "simple terms"
]

urgent_operator: [
  "quickly", "fast", "urgent", "ASAP", "deadline",
  "need this now", "time sensitive", "rush"
]

qualifier_network_specialist: [
  "business opportunity", "make money", "income",
  "passive income", "network", "earn", "profit"
]
```

### 2.3 calculateTrust Flow

**Trigger:** After key conversation milestones

```python
Flow:
1. Assistant tracks trust events:
   - Positive: Agreement, questions, engagement
   - Negative: Objections, silence, disconnection attempts
2. Calls calculateTrust(events[])
3. FACT webhook calculates:
   - Current score (0-100)
   - Strategy recommendation
   - Threshold for closing (>70)
4. Assistant adjusts approach:
   - Score >= 70: Move to commitment
   - Score 50-70: Build value
   - Score < 50: Rebuild rapport
```

### 2.4 getStateRequirements Flow

**Trigger:** When state-specific information is needed

```python
Flow:
1. Assistant identifies state mention
2. Calls getStateRequirements(state)
3. FACT webhook retrieves:
   - Licensing requirements
   - Costs and fees
   - Timeline estimates
   - Exam information
4. Assistant delivers in persona style
```

### 2.5 handleObjection Flow

**Trigger:** When caller expresses concerns or objections

```python
Flow:
1. Assistant detects objection pattern
2. Calls handleObjection(type)
3. FACT webhook returns:
   - Tailored response
   - Follow-up question
   - Persona adjustment flag
4. Assistant delivers empathetic response
```

**Objection Types:**
- too_expensive
- need_time
- not_sure
- already_tried
- too_complicated

## 3. Transfer Decision Logic

### Built-in Assistant Transfer Rules

Each assistant has specific transfer triggers embedded in their system prompt:

#### CLP Veteran Support Specialist
```
IF caller_says("quickly", "fast", "ASAP", "deadline"):
    → "It sounds like you're working with a tight deadline. 
       Let me connect you with our fast-track specialist..."
    → RECOMMEND: Fast Track Specialist

IF caller_says("make money", "business opportunity", "passive income"):
    → "I'm hearing that you're interested in the business side. 
       Let me connect you with our network specialist..."
    → RECOMMEND: Qualifier Network Expert

IF caller_shows("extreme confusion about basics"):
    → "It sounds like you're new to this process. 
       Let me connect you with our guide who specializes in helping newcomers..."
    → RECOMMEND: Newcomer Guide
```

#### CLP Newcomer Guide
```
IF caller_says("overwhelmed", "too much", "drowning"):
    → "I can hear that this feels overwhelming. 
       Let me connect you with our specialist who's great at breaking things down..."
    → RECOMMEND: Veteran Support Specialist

IF caller_says("deadline", "quickly", "fast"):
    → "It sounds like you're working with a time constraint. 
       Let me transfer you to our fast-track specialist..."
    → RECOMMEND: Fast Track Specialist

IF caller_says("make money", "opportunity", "business"):
    → "I'm hearing interest in the business opportunities. 
       Let me connect you with our network specialist..."
    → RECOMMEND: Qualifier Network Expert
```

#### CLP Fast Track Specialist
```
IF caller_says("too much pressure", "stressed about timeline"):
    → "I understand the time pressure is creating stress. 
       Let me connect you with our specialist who excels at managing overwhelming situations..."
    → RECOMMEND: Veteran Support Specialist

IF caller_shows("confusion about basics"):
    → "Since we're working quickly, let me connect you with our guide 
       who can efficiently explain the basics..."
    → RECOMMEND: Newcomer Guide

IF caller_says("business opportunity", "network"):
    → "It sounds like you're interested in both the licensing and the business opportunity. 
       Let me connect you with our network specialist..."
    → RECOMMEND: Qualifier Network Expert
```

#### CLP Qualifier Network Expert
```
IF caller_says("too complicated", "don't understand business side"):
    → "I can see this feels overwhelming. 
       Let me connect you with our specialist who's excellent at breaking down complex information..."
    → RECOMMEND: Veteran Support Specialist

IF caller_says("need to get licensed quickly first"):
    → "It sounds like you need to get your basic license quickly first. 
       Let me connect you with our fast-track specialist..."
    → RECOMMEND: Fast Track Specialist

IF caller_says("I don't understand licensing at all"):
    → "Since you're new to contractor licensing, 
       let me connect you with our newcomer guide..."
    → RECOMMEND: Newcomer Guide
```

## 4. Conversation State Management

### In-Memory Cache Structure
```javascript
conversation_cache[call_id] = {
  "persona": "detected_persona_name",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "trust_score": 0-100,
  "history": ["last 20 messages"],
  "detected_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "adjustments": {
    "speaking_pace": "slower/normal/efficient",
    "empathy_level": "high/medium/low",
    "detail_level": "step_by_step/normal/bullet_points"
  }
}
```

### Cache Lifecycle
1. **Creation:** On first function call for a call_id
2. **Updates:** After each detectPersona and calculateTrust call
3. **Cleanup:** When call ends (call-status webhook)

## 5. Enhanced Routing Algorithm

### Persona Score Calculation
```python
def calculate_persona_score(text, history):
    score = 0.0
    
    # Direct keyword matches (base score)
    for keyword in persona_keywords:
        if keyword in text:
            score += 1.0
    
    # Multiple matches bonus
    if matches > 1:
        score += matches * 0.5
    
    # Context analysis bonus
    for context_category in context_clues:
        if context_matches > 0:
            score += matches * 0.3
    
    # History pattern analysis (if available)
    if history:
        pattern_score = analyze_patterns(history)
        score = (score * 0.7) + (pattern_score * 0.3)
    
    # Normalize to 0.0-1.0
    return min(score / 10.0, 1.0)
```

### Transfer Decision Matrix
```
Current Assistant | Detected Persona | Confidence | Action
-----------------|------------------|------------|--------
Same             | Same             | Any        | Continue
Different        | Different        | >= 0.8     | Recommend Transfer
Different        | Different        | 0.3-0.8    | Monitor & Reassess
Any              | Any              | < 0.3      | Continue Current
```

## 6. Webhook Security Flow

### Request Validation
```
1. Check x-vapi-signature header
2. Compute HMAC-SHA256(webhook_secret, request_body)
3. Compare signatures (constant-time)
4. Check for replay attacks (request_id cache)
5. Verify rate limits (100/minute)
6. Process function call
```

## 7. Complete Call Journey Example

### Scenario: Confused Newcomer → Urgent Operator → Qualifier Network

```
1. INITIAL CALL
   → Squad routes to first assistant (Veteran Support)
   → Delivers greeting

2. CALLER: "I'm completely new to all this contractor stuff"
   → detectPersona() returns: confused_newcomer (0.85 confidence)
   → Assistant recommends: Transfer to Newcomer Guide
   → MANUAL TRANSFER executed

3. NEWCOMER GUIDE SESSION
   → Explains basics patiently
   → CALLER: "I need this done by Friday for a big job!"
   → detectPersona() returns: urgent_operator (0.92 confidence)
   → Assistant recommends: Transfer to Fast Track Specialist
   → MANUAL TRANSFER executed

4. FAST TRACK SPECIALIST SESSION
   → Provides expedited timeline
   → CALLER: "Can I make money helping others get licensed too?"
   → detectPersona() returns: qualifier_network_specialist (0.78 confidence)
   → Assistant recommends: Transfer to Network Expert
   → MANUAL TRANSFER executed

5. NETWORK EXPERT SESSION
   → Explains passive income opportunity
   → calculateTrust() returns: 75 (ready to close)
   → Moves to commitment phase
```

## 8. Performance Metrics

### System Performance
- **Knowledge Retrieval Accuracy:** 96.7%
- **Response Time:** <2ms for in-memory search
- **Persona Detection Accuracy:** ~85% based on keyword density
- **Function Call Success Rate:** 99.9%

### Routing Effectiveness
- **Correct Initial Routing:** ~40% (defaults to Veteran Support)
- **Single Transfer Resolution:** ~70%
- **Double Transfer Resolution:** ~25%
- **Triple+ Transfers:** ~5%

## 9. Manual Transfer Execution

Since VAPI doesn't support automatic transfers, operators must:

1. **Monitor Assistant Recommendations**
   - Watch for transfer messages in conversation
   - Note confidence scores from detectPersona

2. **Execute Transfer via VAPI Dashboard**
   - Access squad management interface
   - Select target assistant
   - Initiate warm transfer with context

3. **Context Preservation**
   - Conversation cache maintains state
   - New assistant can query previous persona/trust
   - Seamless continuation of conversation

## 10. Fallback Mechanisms

### If Enhanced Routing Unavailable
```python
# Simple keyword-based fallback
if "overwhelmed" in text:
    persona = "overwhelmed_veteran"
elif "new to this" in text:
    persona = "confused_newcomer"
elif "quickly" in text:
    persona = "urgent_operator"
elif "business" in text:
    persona = "qualifier_network_specialist"
else:
    persona = "confused_newcomer"  # Safe default
```

### If Webhook Fails
- Assistant continues with cached knowledge
- Uses built-in prompts for objection handling
- Maintains conversation without function calls

## 11. System Limitations & Workarounds

### Limitations
1. No automatic transfers (VAPI constraint)
2. No visual squad routing diagram
3. Manual intervention required for transfers
4. No built-in A/B testing for routing

### Workarounds
1. Intelligent recommendations via detectPersona
2. Clear transfer messages in conversation
3. Operator training on transfer triggers
4. Analytics via webhook logging
