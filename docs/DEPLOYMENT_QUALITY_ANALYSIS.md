## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Overwhelmed Veteran Content (21 entries - Need 40+)
**Sample Missing Content:**
- "I'm overwhelmed by the licensing process, where do I start?"
- "Can you walk me through this step-by-step?"  
- "What if I make a mistake on my application?"
- "Is there someone who can help me personally?"

### 2. Skeptical Researcher Content (3 entries - Need 20+)  
**Sample Missing Content:**
- "What's your success rate with data to back it up?"
- "Can you show me independent reviews or testimonials?"

- "What certifications or credentials do you have?"

### 3. Failed Test Question Coverage (0/104 addressed)
**Priority Questions to Address:**
- "What's the cheapest state to get licensed in?" (Currently returns Georgia process instead)
- "Can I get a discount if I refer others?" (Currently returns EPA RRP info)  
- "How much can I save doing it myself?" (Partially addressed but needs improvement)
