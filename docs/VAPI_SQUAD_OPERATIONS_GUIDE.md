## How the System Works

### 1. Incoming Call Flow
```
Call arrives ‚Üí Routes to first assistant (Veteran Support)
    ‚Üì
Assistant greets caller
    ‚Üì
System analyzes conversation
    ‚Üì
If transfer needed ‚Üí Assistant recommends specific specialist
    ‚Üì
Operator executes manual transfer
```

### 2. When Assistants Recommend Transfers

The assistants will say things like:
- *"It sounds like you're working with a tight deadline. Let me connect you with our fast-track specialist..."*
- *"I can hear that this feels overwhelming. Let me connect you with our specialist who's great at breaking things down..."*
- *"I'm hearing interest in the business opportunities. Let me connect you with our network specialist..."*

**When you hear these, prepare to transfer the call.**

## Behind the Scenes Functions

The system automatically:
1. **Searches Knowledge Base** - When callers ask questions
2. **Detects Personas** - Analyzes conversation patterns
3. **Tracks Trust** - Monitors engagement level
4. **Handles Objections** - Provides appropriate responses
5. **Gets State Requirements** - Retrieves location-specific info

## Trust Score Indicators

Watch for these assistant behaviors based on trust levels:

| Trust Level | Assistant Behavior | What It Means |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| üî¥ **Low (0-49)** | Focus on rebuilding rapport | Caller is skeptical or disengaged |
| üü° **Medium (50-69)** | Building value, addressing concerns | Caller is interested but has questions |
| üü¢ **High (70-100)** | Moving toward commitment | Caller is ready to take action |

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Overwhelmed Veteran
```
Caller: "I've been contracting for 20 years but this licensing stuff is killing me"
System: Detects overwhelmed_veteran persona
Action: Keep on Veteran Support Assistant (already matched)
```

### Scenario 2: The Rushed Newcomer
```
Caller: "I'm new to this and need my license by next Friday!"
System: Detects both confused_newcomer AND urgent_operator
Action: Transfer to Fast Track (urgency takes priority)
```

### Scenario 3: The Opportunity Seeker
```
Caller: "Can I really make money helping others get licensed?"
System: Detects qualifier_network_specialist
Action: Transfer to Network Expert
```

## Manual Transfer Process

### In VAPI Dashboard:
1. Click on active call
2. Select "Transfer" option
3. Choose target assistant from squad
4. Confirm warm transfer

### Transfer Best Practices:
- ‚úÖ Wait for complete transfer recommendation from assistant
- ‚úÖ Allow assistant to provide context before transferring
- ‚úÖ Ensure smooth handoff with transfer message
- ‚ùå Don't transfer mid-sentence
- ‚ùå Don't transfer without assistant recommendation
- ‚ùå Don't transfer more than twice per call (indicates mismatch)

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **First Call Resolution:** Aim for 70%+
- **Average Transfers per Call:** Should be < 1.5
- **Transfer Success Rate:** Should be > 90%
- **Trust Score at Close:** Should be > 70

### Red Flags:
- Multiple transfers (3+) in single call
- Trust score dropping after transfer
- Caller asking for different specialist than recommended
- Repeated transfers between same two assistants

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Assistant not recommending transfers
**Solution:** The persona detection may have low confidence. Listen for manual cues and use judgment.

### Issue: Multiple transfer recommendations
**Solution:** Prioritize based on urgency > confusion > business interest > overwhelm

### Issue: Caller refuses transfer
**Solution:** Current assistant can handle most queries; transfers are for optimization, not requirement

### Issue: System functions not working
**Solution:** Assistants have fallback responses and can continue conversation without webhook functions

- Assistants continue with built-in knowledge
- Manual persona detection based on this guide
