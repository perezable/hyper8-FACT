# FACT System Training Capabilities

## Overview

The FACT system includes a sophisticated training system that allows it to learn and improve from user interactions. The system can adapt its search patterns, learn new synonyms, and adjust scoring weights to achieve better accuracy over time.

## Key Features

### 1. Feedback-Based Learning
- Learn from user feedback (correct/incorrect/partial)
- Reinforce successful patterns
- Adjust weights for failed queries
- Learn corrections from user-provided expected answers

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Identify common query patterns
- Group similar queries for pattern-based improvements
- Learn domain-specific terminology

### 3. Synonym Learning
- Automatically discover synonyms from successful matches
- Learn abbreviations and alternative terms
- Build domain-specific vocabulary

### 4. Weight Optimization
- Dynamic adjustment of scoring weights
- Balance between question, answer, and keyword matching
- Continuous optimization toward target accuracy

## How It Works

### Training Flow

```
User Query → Search → Result → User Feedback → Learning → Retraining → Improved Search
```

### Learning Process

1. **Positive Reinforcement** (Correct Feedback)
   - Stores successful query patterns
   - Learns synonyms from fuzzy matches
   - Increases weights for successful strategies

2. **Negative Reinforcement** (Incorrect Feedback)
   - Identifies failure patterns
   - Learns corrections from user input
   - Decreases weights for failing strategies

3. **Partial Reinforcement** (Partial Feedback)
   - Small positive adjustments
   - Identifies areas for improvement

## API Endpoints

### Training Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/training/feedback` | POST | Provide feedback on search results |
| `/training/status` | GET | Get current training statistics |
| `/training/retrain` | POST | Trigger manual retraining |
| `/training/suggestions` | GET | Get AI-generated improvements |
| `/training/export` | POST | Export training data |
| `/training/import` | POST | Import training data |
| `/training/history` | GET | View training history |
| `/training/auto-train` | POST | Enable/disable auto-training |

## Usage Examples

### 1. Providing Feedback

```python
# Correct result
POST /training/feedback
{
    "query": "Georgia contractor license requirements",
    "result_id": 123,
    "feedback": "correct"
}

# Incorrect result with correction
POST /training/feedback
{
    "query": "What's the ROI on licensing?",
    "result_id": 456,
    "feedback": "incorrect",
    "expected_answer": "First project typically returns 3-10x investment"
}
```

### 2. Checking Training Status

```python
GET /training/status

Response:
{
    "total_examples": 50,
    "accuracy": 0.84,
    "target_accuracy": 0.967,
    "learned_synonyms": 25,
    "learned_patterns": 8,
    "status": "Training",
    "current_weights": {
        "question_weight": 0.38,
        "answer_weight": 0.42,
        "keyword_weight": 0.15,
        "variation_weight": 0.05
    }
}
```

### 3. Getting Improvement Suggestions

```python
GET /training/suggestions

Response:
[
    {
        "type": "synonym_suggestion",
        "suggestion": "Add synonyms for 'ROI': return, investment, payback",
        "details": {...}
    },
    {
        "type": "pattern_improvement",
        "suggestion": "Pattern 'cost_query' has 5 failures. Consider adding training data.",
        "details": {...}
    }
]
```

## Training Strategies

### 1. Continuous Learning
Enable auto-training to learn from high-confidence matches:
```python
POST /training/auto-train
{"enabled": true}
```

### 2. Batch Training
Collect feedback over time and retrain periodically:
```python
# After collecting feedback
POST /training/retrain
```

### 3. Transfer Learning
Export training from one deployment and import to another:
```python
# Export from production
POST /training/export
{"file_path": "prod_training.json"}

# Import to staging
POST /training/import
{"file_path": "prod_training.json"}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Feedback Collection
- Implement feedback UI in your application
- Track user satisfaction with results
- Collect corrections for failed searches

### 2. Periodic Retraining
- Retrain after every 10-20 feedback examples
- Monitor accuracy improvements
- Export training data regularly

### 3. Quality Control
- Review improvement suggestions
- Validate learned synonyms
- Monitor weight adjustments

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Track accuracy trends
- Monitor response times after retraining
- Set accuracy targets (default: 96.7%)

## Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Learning Rates
Adjust how quickly the system learns:
```python
trainer.learning_rate = 0.1  # Default
trainer.learning_rate = 0.2  # Faster learning
trainer.learning_rate = 0.05  # Slower, more stable
```

### 2. Confidence Thresholds
Set minimum confidence for auto-training:
```python
trainer.min_confidence = 0.7  # Only learn from high-confidence matches
```

### 3. Batch Size Configuration
Control when automatic retraining triggers:
```python
trainer.batch_size = 10  # Retrain every 10 examples
```

## Training Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct results
2. **Learning Rate**: Speed of improvement
3. **Synonym Coverage**: Number of learned synonyms
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Number of identified patterns
5. **Weight Stability**: Convergence of weight adjustments

### Success Metrics

- Target Accuracy: 96.7% (configurable)
- Typical Improvement: 10-20% after 50 examples
- Learning Curve: Logarithmic (fast initial, slower later)

## Integration with VAPI

The training system works seamlessly with VAPI voice agents:

1. **Automatic Feedback**: Collect feedback from call outcomes
2. **Voice-Specific Learning**: Learn pronunciation variations
3. **Context Awareness**: Learn from conversation context
4. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Apply learning during calls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Accuracy Not Improving**
   - Check feedback quality
   - Increase training examples
   - Review weight adjustments
   - Consider manual synonym additions

2. **Over-fitting**
   - Reduce learning rate
   - Increase batch size
   - Balance positive/negative feedback

3. **Slow Response After Training**
   - Limit synonym expansions
   - Optimize index size
   - Review weight distributions
