  "objection_price": {
    "old": "I understand cost is a concern. Consider this: DIY contractors have only a 35-45% approval rate, while our clients achieve 98%. The time you save\u201476 to 118 hours\u2014is worth $6,000 to $18,750 at typical contractor rates.",
    "new": "Yeah, I get it. But look - one job pays for everything. Plus, doing it yourself? Most people fail and waste months."
  },
  "objection_time": {
    "old": "I appreciate you want to think it through. While you're considering, remember that every day without a license costs contractors $500 to $2,500 in lost opportunities.",
    "new": "I hear you. Thing is, every day you wait? You're losing money. Real money. Like $500 a day minimum."

  "value_prop": {
    "old": "Our program guarantees 98% approval rate versus 35-45% for DIY applications, saving you 76-118 hours worth $6,000-$18,750.",
    "new": "So basically, we get almost everyone approved. Saves you about 100 hours too. That's worth like... 10 grand of your time."

  "qualifier_network": {
    "old": "The qualifier network opportunity provides $3,000 to $6,000 monthly passive income by lending your license to vetted contractors.",
    "new": "Oh, and there's this qualifier thing. Some folks make an extra 3 to 6 grand a month. Just for having their license."
  },
  "closing": {
    "old": "Based on everything we've discussed, I can help you get started with the enrollment process today.",
    "new": "So... want me to get you started? I can set everything up right now."
