## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding Questions

To add more questions, modify the `_create_question_bank()` method in `comprehensive_200_question_test.py`:

```python
# Add to existing category
category_questions.append(
    TestQuestion(
        id=question_id,
        category="your_category",
        subcategory="specific_area", 
        difficulty="basic|intermediate|advanced",
        question="Your question text?",
        expected_keywords=["key1", "key2", "key3"],
        persona_alignment="general|specific_persona"
    )
)
```

### Modifying Scoring

Adjust scoring weights in the `_evaluate_response()` method:

```python
# Current weights
accuracy_score = (keyword_score * 0.7 + response_length_score * 0.3)

# Modify as needed
accuracy_score = (keyword_score * 0.8 + response_length_score * 0.2)
```

### Custom Categories

Add new categories by:
1. Creating questions with new category names
2. Updating the analysis methods
3. Adding category-specific evaluation criteria

## üìã Best Practices

3. **Focus Improvements** - Address lowest-scoring categories first
4. **Validate Changes** - Test after each knowledge update

### Interpreting Results

1. **Look at Trends** - Compare multiple test runs
2. **Category Focus** - Identify consistent weak areas
3. **Question Analysis** - Review specific failed questions
4. **Response Quality** - Check for appropriate detail level

### Improving Performance

1. **Add Training Data** - Focus on failed question topics
2. **Enhance Keywords** - Update expected response terms
3. **Persona Training** - Improve audience-specific responses
4. **Response Templates** - Develop consistent answer formats

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError for HVACTrainingBot:**
- Test runs with mock responses if bot unavailable
