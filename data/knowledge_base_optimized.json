You'll invest 80-125 hours of your time worth $6,000-$18,750. Our clients save 76-118 hours and achieve 98% approval rates. The question isn't whether you CAN do it yourself, it's whether your time is better spent building your business while we handle the paperwork.' This information is time-sensitive.

Handyman licenses typically cap projects at $1,000-$5,000 depending on your state. With a contractor license, you can bid on $50K-$500K+ projects. The math is simple: one contractor-level project equals 10-100 handyman jobs. You've proven you can do the work - now let's remove the artificial ceiling on your income.

      "question": "objection_handling information",
      "answer": "When customers express economic concerns: 'I understand economic uncertainty makes every investment decision critical. That's exactly why getting licensed now is more important than ever. In uncertain times, clients choose licensed contractors for security and legal protection. Licensed contractors are last to lose work and first to get new projects. Your competition is cutting corners - this is your opportunity to differentiate. The contractors who invested in licensing during the 2008 recession dominated the recovery. Economic uncertainty makes licensing essential, not optional.' This information is time-sensitive.
