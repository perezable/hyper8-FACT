      "answer": "DIY costs seem lower upfront but hidden costs add up: State fees ($200-800), exam fees ($150-400), study materials ($200-500), time investment (80-125 hours at $50/hour = $4,000-6,250), mistake corrections ($300-1,200), reapplication fees if rejected ($200-500). Total DIY cost: $5,050-9,650. Our service: $4,995 all-inclusive. You save $55-4,655 PLUS 80-125 hours of your time. 98.2% success rate vs 42% DIY rate means you likely succeed first try with us vs potentially failing multiple times DIY.",
