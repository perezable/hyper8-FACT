      "answer": "True contractor license ROI calculation: Initial investment (licensing fees + training + bonding + insurance) typically $2,000-8,000, annual revenue increase from licensed work averages 35-65%, premium pricing ability adds 15-25% to project values, bonding capacity enables larger projects (10x revenue potential), insurance rates decrease 10-30% with proper licensing. Break-even typically 3-8 months, 5-year ROI often 800-2,000%.",
