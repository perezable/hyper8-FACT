However, here's what our data shows: DIY success rate is only 35-45% first-time approval with 60-70% exam pass rates. That means 55-65% face delays, reapplication fees, and lost opportunities. You'll invest 80-125 hours of your time worth $6,000-$18,750. Our clients save 76-118 hours and achieve 98% approval rates. The question isn't whether you CAN do it yourself, it's whether your time is better spent building your business while we handle the paperwork.'",
